A repo where I have put all my competitive programming practice answers in the language Rust from different websites. Feel free to use it for reference & inspiration.

Executing the code is pretty simple. There's a bin folder just copy the rust file you want to run in that folder & execute the command:

```
cargo run --bin <filename_without_extension>
```

Replace `<filename_without_extension>` with the name of the Rust file (without the `.rs` extension).
